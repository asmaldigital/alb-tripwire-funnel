    <h2 class="text-center mb-3">Can You Relate?</h2>
    <ul class="pain-list">
      <li>You stare at a blank page for hours, trying to write copy that sounds professional but still sounds like YOU</li>
      <li>You've hired freelance copywriters who missed your voice completely, and charged hundreds for generic garbage</li>
      <li>You've tried ChatGPT but it sounds like a robot wrote your marketing, because it kind of did</li>
      <li>You know good copy is the difference between a lead and a stranger, but you're not a copywriter</li>
      <li>You spend more time writing one email than actually serving your clients</li>
      <li>Every sales page, every email, every social post feels like pulling teeth</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-center mt-3" style="font-size:1.15rem; font-weight:500; color:var(--slate);">If any of that hits home, you're not alone. And you're not the problem. Your tools are.</p>

      <li>Generic ChatGPT prompts that produce bland, corporate-sounding copy no one reads</li>

      <li>Copy templates and swipe files that sound nothing like your brand</li>
      <li>"AI writing tools" that produce the same watered-down output for everyone</li>
      <li>Spending entire weekends trying to write a single sales page, only to scrap it Monday morning</li>

    <p class="text-center mt-3" style="color:var(--light-gray); font-size:1.1rem;">None of it worked. Not because you lack effort, but because none of those tools were trained to write copy that actually converts.</p>

<!-- SECTION: Bridge / Story -->
<section class="section section-light">
  <div class="container" style="max-width:720px;">
    <h2 class="text-center mb-3">Here's What Changed Everything</h2>
    <p>I built 19 custom AI marketing assistants for the members inside my coaching program. Each one is trained for a specific job: prospecting, follow-ups, ad copy, video scripts, you name it.</p>
    <p>But one of them consistently outperforms all the others. Members use it every single day. It's the one they open first. It's the one that gets them replies, booked calls, and paying clients.</p>
    <p>It's the <strong style="color:var(--deep-navy);">Client Magnet Copy GPT</strong>.</p>
    <p>It's trained on the frameworks used by the greatest direct-response copywriters who ever lived. Eugene Schwartz, Gary Halbert, Claude Hopkins, David Ogilvy. Not random internet content. Not recycled blog posts. Proven frameworks that have generated billions of dollars in sales.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:500; color:var(--deep-navy); font-size:1.15rem;">And now I'm giving you access to it for less than the price of a coffee.</p>
    <p>This GPT is where most people start. But inside my coaching program, members take it further. They build custom Claude Projects trained specifically on their business, their voice, their clients. That's what I call Thinking AI. The GPT you're about to get is your first taste of what's possible.</p>

    <p>Because once you see what ONE trained AI assistant can do for your copy, you'll want the full team.</p>
    <p>I have 19 of these. Each one trained for a specific part of your marketing: prospecting, follow-ups, content creation, ad copy, video scripts, objection handling, and more.</p>
    <p>But the real power? Inside AI Lead Builder, members go beyond GPTs. They build custom Claude Projects trained on their specific business. AI that knows their voice, their offers, their clients. AI that connects to their CRM, their calendar, their email. That's Thinking AI, and it's the reason our members get results that generic tools can't touch.</p>
    <p>This $7 GPT is your entry point. It's the easiest way to experience what a purpose-built AI marketing assistant can do, with zero risk.</p>
    <p style="color:var(--electric-cyan); font-weight:600; font-size:1.1rem;">Most people who try the Client Magnet Copy GPT come back for the full toolkit within a week.</p>

    <div class="faq-list">

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What exactly is the Client Magnet Copy GPT?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>It's a custom-trained AI assistant that lives inside ChatGPT. It's been trained on proven direct-response copywriting frameworks to write copy that attracts and converts clients for your business. Think of it as having a professional copywriter on call 24/7, one that already knows the frameworks that have generated billions in sales.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do I need ChatGPT Plus to use this?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes, you need a ChatGPT Plus subscription ($20/month) to access custom GPTs. If you don't have one yet, it's worth the investment. This GPT alone will save you hundreds in copywriting costs every month.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What types of copy can it write?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Emails, landing pages, ad copy, social media posts, video scripts, sales pages, webinar scripts, cold outreach, follow-up sequences, and more. If it involves words that sell, this GPT handles it.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How is this different from just using ChatGPT?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Regular ChatGPT gives generic output because it has no marketing training. The Client Magnet Copy GPT is trained on the frameworks of legendary copywriters like Eugene Schwartz, Gary Halbert, and David Ogilvy. It writes copy that converts, not just copy that exists.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Will the copy sound like me?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes. The first thing the GPT does is learn about your business, your voice, and your audience. Every piece of copy is customized to sound like you, just a version of you that happens to be an expert copywriter.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What if I'm not happy with it?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>You're covered by our 30-day money-back guarantee. If the GPT doesn't help you write better copy, email us for a full refund. No questions asked.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Why is it only $7?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Because I want you to experience what a trained AI assistant can do. This GPT is the starting point. Inside AI Lead Builder, members get all 19 assistants plus access to Claude Skills and Projects, where they build Thinking AI trained on their own business. Once you see the results from this one, you'll understand why our members never go back to generic AI.</p>
